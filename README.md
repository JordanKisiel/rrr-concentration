# Base Project Template for the RRR Course

This is the base project template to be used for the React Reps & Reaches (RRR) course. It utilizes [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool (because its fast) and [Material UI for React](https://mui.com/) (so you can concentrate on app logic rather than styling and building basic UI components).

## Motivation for RRR Course

In the [Little Book of Talent](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Talent-Improving-Skills/dp/034553025X) by Daniel Coyle, the author emphasizes the importance of "reps" and "reaches" in skill development. The more "reps" (repetions) you get the better. Likewise, the more "reaches" (challenges that stretch you somewhat beyond your current ability) the better. To maximize the incidence of both of these events, the author suggests shrinking the "space" within which you practice. Therefore, the React Reps & Reaches course consists of a series of small projects that, with practice, can be finished in a day or two at most. This allows the developer to more quickly build an intuition for the patterns present in solving problems with React.

### Why the Concentration on App Logic?

The Material UI kit is utilized because 1) it's quite good but more importantly 2) it allows UIs for projects to be built quickly and more time to be spent implementing app logic and features. While being able to translate a given design into a working UI is a valuable skill in its own right for a frontend developer, I personally found that I was getting much more practice (reps & reaches) with styling components than I was with the actual app logic that allowed me to practice the more intermediate and advanced features of React. There are also plenty of existing resources for good designs that you can practice translating into a working UI if that's where you need skill development: [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) being the best that I've found.

## Continued development

As of now, there are no projects available as I'm currently in the process of developing small projects myself for my own practice as well as verifying that they're good candidates for the eventual first release of the course. Eventually I'd like to launch a beta version of the course with 5 or 6 small projects that cover a variety of React features. Ultimately, I'd like this course to serve as a learning supplement to courses like that on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) or even just to the [React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) themselves.

### TODO

- Add a 'how to use' section to this readme
- Create a website for the course with under construction page
